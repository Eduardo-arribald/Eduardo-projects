> What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
   I will make a program for countability administration of startups, in a simple and comprehensible way.
   Features:
   Presentation of assets, passives, and capital(elements of a general balance) and information of a statement of income.
   This information will be easily watchable in an excel file.

> What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
   Knowledge of all the information under a basic balance sheet and a statement of income.

> In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less
  in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
   The best outcome would be an excel sheet in wich you could see all the information inputed, sorted and easily readable.
   A good outcome would be an excel sheet with just the statement of income of all the information inputed, sorted and easily readable.
   A better outcome would be a combination of these two.

Based in the book: Contabilidad para PYMES, FAECO.
