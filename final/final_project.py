#    What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
#   I will make a program for countability administration of startups, in a simple and comprehensible way.
#   Features:
#    Presentation of assets, passives, and capital(elements of a general balance) and information of a statement of income.
#    This information will be easily watchable in an excel file.
#    What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
#    Knowledge of all the information under a basic balance sheet and a statement of income.
#    In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
