> What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
   I will make a program for countability administration of startups, in a simple and comprehensible way.
   Features:
   Presentation of assets, passives, and capital(elements of a general balance).
   This information will be easily watchable in an csv file.

> What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
   Knowledge of all the information under a basic balance sheet and more about dictionaries' indexes. Also know more about the management
   of multiple while loops and how to break them.

> In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less
  in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
   The best outcome would be a csv file in wich you could see all the information inputed, sorted and easily readable. You should be able of
   see and control everything from the program, without need of checking other app. This program shouldn't output errors and should consider
   all the possible answers from the users.
   A good outcome would be an csv with just the balance sheet of all the information inputed, sorted and easily readable.
   A better outcome would be a combination of these two.

Based in the book: Contabilidad para PYMES, FAECO.
